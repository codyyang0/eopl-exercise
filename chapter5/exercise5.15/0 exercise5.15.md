Exercise 5.15 [*] Our continuation data type contains just the single constant, end-cont, and all the other continuation-builders have a single continuation argu- ment. Implement continuations by representing them as lists, where (end-cont) is represented by the empty list, and each other continuation is represented by a non- empty list whose car contains a distinctive data structure (called frame or activation record) and whose cdr contains the embedded continuation. Observe that the inter- preter treats these lists like a stack (of frames).
